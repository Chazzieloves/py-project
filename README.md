## Introduction 

This is a simple memory game implemented in Python. The objective of the game is to find pairs of cards with matching letters by revealing them one at a time. The game continues until all pairs are found, and your goal is to complete it with as few attempts as possible. 

## Rules 
- The game board consists of a grid with face-down cards. 
- Players take turns revealing two cards at a time by specifying their row and column numbers.
- If the two revealed cards have matching symbols, they are considered a pair and are displayed on the board.
- If the two revealed cards do not match, they are returned to a face-down position. - Players continue taking turns until all pairs have been found.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched, and the player's performance is measured by the number of attempts made to complete the game.
